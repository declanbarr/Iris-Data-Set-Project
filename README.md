# Iris Data Set Project


## Project for Programming and Scripting Module


### Project Plan
#### Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
##### Completion date: 3rd April 2018
* Read wikipedia article on Iris Flower Data Set
    * ~Introduction~
    * Use of the data set
* Read unkown terms from Iris Flower Data Set on wikipedia    
* Read references on Iris Flower Data Set on wikipedia
* Type up summary
#### Summarise the data set
##### Completion date: 12th April 2018
* For each species calculate:
   * Five-number summary (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary)
      * min
      * Q1
      * Q2 (technically median)
      * Q3
      * Max
   * Average
      * Mean
      * Mode
      * Median
   * Spread
      * Variance
      * Standard Deviation
      * IQR
      * Range
* Read https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/r/iris_plots/
    * Scatter plots of sw, sl, pl and pw.
    * Can relationships be made between sizes eg
        * sl/sw and plot against pl/pw?
        * sw times sl plotted against pw times pl?
        * 1/sw plotted against 1/sl
        * plot of area of sepal vs area of peta
        * 1/ log sw etc
        * multiply or divide a feature by a factor
        * etc
        * Is this what machine learning does? 
#### Summarise investigations
