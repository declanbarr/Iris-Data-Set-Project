### Summary on the Iris Flower Data Set

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set]
#### Wiki intro
The Iris Flower Data Set is a data set collected by Edgar Anderson. It consists of 50 samples for each of Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor; three related species of Iris flower. It is a multivariate data set meaning there is more than one variable. There are a total of 150 records under 5 attributes: petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and class. (picture on petals and sepals)

Ronald Fischer used the data set to perform a linear discriminant analysis which he detailed in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. A linear discriminant analysis is .....

#### Use of the data set
Data set contains two clusters. One cluster contains Iris setosa and the other contains Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. (provdie pictures on flowers) 

(Provide link to wikipedia article above and to Fischer's 1936 paper)

### Project Plan
#### Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
##### Completion date: ~3rd April 2018~ 12th April 2018 (To be completed in parallel with "Summarise the Data Set")
* Read wikipedia article on Iris Flower Data Set
    * ~Introduction~
    * Use of the data set
        * ~First two paragraphs~
        * Last paragraph (too many unkown terms)
* Read unknown terms from Iris Flower Data Set on wikipedia  
    * linear discriminant analysis/model https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azXCzI57Yfc
    * support vector machines
    * cluster analysis (also explain what a cluster is)
    * data mining
    * nonlinear branching principal component
    * metro map
* Read references on Iris Flower Data Set on wikipedia
    * ~Edgar Anderson (1936). "The species problem in Iris"~ (contains a lot of irrelevant information for this project)

    * Will the real iris data please stand up?
* Type up summary (This would be best to be done immediatley instead of typing everything up at the end)
#### Summarise the data set
##### Completion date: 12th April 2018
* For each species calculate:
   * Five-number summary (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-number_summary)
      * min
      * Q1
      * Q2 (technically median)
      * Q3
      * Max
   * Average
      * Mean
      * Mode
      * Median
   * Spread
      * Variance
      * Standard Deviation
      * IQR
      * Range
* Read https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/r/iris_plots/
    * Scatter plots of sw, sl, pl and pw.
    * Can relationships be made between sizes eg
        * sl/sw and plot against pl/pw?
        * sw times sl plotted against pw times pl?
        * 1/sw plotted against 1/sl
        * plot of area of sepal vs area of peta
        * 1/ log sw etc
        * multiply or divide a feature by a factor
        * etc
        * Is this what machine learning does? 
* Produce graphs, see http://www.statisticshowto.com/types-graphs/#segmentedbartypes
#### Summarise investigations
##### Completion date: 21st April 2018


#### Contingency week
##### Completion date: 29th April 2018
